# MMKV Change Log

## v1.2.13 / 2022-03-30

### Android
* Fix crash on using Ashmem while `MMKV_DISABLE_CRYPT` macro is defined.

### iOS
* Add ability to retrieve key existece while getting value, aka `-[MMKV getXXX:forKey:hasValue:]` methods.

### POSIX
* Add ability to retrieve key existece while getting value, aka `MMKV::getXXX(key, defaultValue, hasValue)` methods.

### Win32
* Add ability to retrieve key existece while getting value, aka `MMKV::getXXX(key, defaultValue, hasValue)` methods.

## v1.2.12 / 2022-01-17
### Changes for All platforms
* Fix a bug that a subsequential `clearAll()` call may fail to take effect in multi-process mode.
* Hide some OpenSSL symbols to prevent link-time symbol conflict, when an App somehow also static linking OpenSSL.

### Android
* Upgrade `compileSdkVersion` & `targetSdkVersion` from `30` to `31`.

## v1.2.11 / 2021-10-26

### Android
* Due to increasing report about crash inside STL, we have decided to make MMKV **static linking** `libc++` **by default**. Starting from v1.2.11, `com.tencent:mmkv-static` is the same as `com.tencent:mmkv`.
* For those still in need of MMKV with shared linking of `libc++_shared`, you could use `com.tencent:mmkv-shared` instead.
* Add backup & restore ability.

### iOS / macOS
* Add backup & restore ability.
* Support tvOS.
* Fix a compile error on some old Xcode.

### Flutter (v1.2.12)
* Add backup & restore ability.

### POSIX / golang / Python
* Add backup & restore ability.
* Fix a compile error on Gentoo.

### Win32
* Add backup & restore ability.

## v1.2.10 / 2021-06-25
This version is mainly for Android & Flutter.  

### Android
* Complete **JavaDoc documentation** for all public methods, classes, and interfaces. From now on, you can find the [API reference online](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.tencent/mmkv).
* Drop the support of **armeabi** arch. Due to some local build cache mistake, the last version (v1.2.9) of MMKV still has an unstripped armeabi arch inside. This is fixed.
* Change `MMKV.mmkvWithID()` from returning `null` to throwing exceptions on any error.
* Add `MMKV.actualSize()` to get the actual used size of the file.
* Mark `MMKV.commit()` & `MMKV.apply()` as deprecated, to avoid some misuse after migration from SharedPreferences to MMKV.

### Flutter (v1.2.11)
* Bug Fixed: When building on iOS, occasionally it will fail on symbol conflict with other libs. We have renamed all public native methods to avoid potential conflict.
* Keep up with MMKV native lib v1.2.10.

## v1.2.9 / 2021-05-26
This version is mainly for Android & Flutter.  

### Android
* Drop the support of **armeabi** arch. As has been mention in the last release, to avoid some crashes on the old NDK (r16b), and make the most of a more stable `libc++`, we have decided to upgrade MMKV's building NDK in this release. That means we can't support **armeabi** anymore. Those who still in need of armeabi can **build from sources** by following the [instruction in the wiki](https://github.com/Tencent/MMKV/wiki/android_setup).

We really appreciate your understanding.

### Flutter (v1.2.10)
* Bug Fixed: When calling `MMKV.encodeString()` with an empty string value on Android, `MMKV.decodeString()` will return `null`.
* Bug Fixed: After **upgrading** from Flutter 1.20+ to 2.0+, calling `MMKV.defaultMMKV()` on Android might fail to load, you can try calling `MMKV.defaultMMKV(cryptKey: '\u{2}U')` with an **encrytion key** '\u{2}U' instead.
* Keep up with MMKV native lib v1.2.9.

## v1.2.8 / 2021-05-06
This will be the last version that supports **armeabi arch** on Android. To avoid some crashes on the old NDK (r16b), and make the most of a more stable `libc++`, we have decided to upgrade MMKV's building NDK in the next release. That means we can't support **armeabi** anymore.  

We really appreciate your understanding.

### Android
* Migrate MMKV to Maven Central Repository. For versions older than v1.2.7 (including), they are still available on JCenter.
* Add `MMKV.disableProcessModeChecker()`. There are some native crash reports due to the process mode checker. You can disable it manually.
* For the same reason described above (native crashed), MMKV will now turn off the process mode checker on a non-debuggable app (aka, a release build).
* For MMKV to detect whether the app is debuggable or not, when calling `MMKV.initialize()` to customize the root directory, a `context` parameter is required now.

### iOS / macOS
* Min iOS support has been **upgrade to iOS 9**.
* Support building by Xcode 12.

### Flutter (v1.2.9)
* Support null-safety.
* Upgrade to flutter 2.0.
* Fix a crash on the iOS when calling `encodeString()` with an empty string value.

**Known Issue on Flutter**  

* When calling `encodeString()` with an empty string value on Android, `decodeString()` will return `null`. This bug will be fixed in the next version of Android Native Lib. iOS does not have such a bug.

### Win32
* Fix a compile error on Visual Studio 2019.

## v1.2.7 / 2020-12-25
Happy holidays everyone!
 
### Changes for All platforms
* Fix a bug when calling `sync()` with `false ` won't do `msync()` asynchronous and won't return immediately.

### Android
* Fix an null pointer exception when calling `putStringSet()` with `null`.
* Complete review of all MMKV methods about Java nullable/nonnull annotation.
* Add API for `MMKV.initialize()` with both `Context` and `LibLoader` parammeters.

### Flutter (v1.2.8)
* Fix a crash on the iOS simulator when accessing the default MMKV instance.
* Fix a bug on iOS when initing the default MMKV instance with a crypt key, the instance is still in plaintext.

### Golang
Add golang for POSIX platforms. Most things actually work!. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Tencent/MMKV/wiki/golang_setup) for information.

## v1.2.6 / 2020-11-27
### Changes for All platforms
* Fix a file corruption when calling `reKey()` after `removeKeys()` has just been called.

### Android
* Fix compile error when `MMKV_DISABLE_CRYPT` is set.
* Add a preprocess directive `MMKV_DISABLE_FLUTTER` to disable flutter plugin features. If you integrate MMKV by source code, and if you are pretty sure the flutter plugin is not needed, you can turn that off to save some binary size.

### Flutter (v1.2.7)
Add MMKV support for **Flutter** on iOS & Android platform.  Most things actually work!  
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Tencent/MMKV/wiki/flutter_setup) for more info.

## v1.2.5 / 2020-11-13
This is a pre-version for Flutter. The official Flutter plugin of MMKV will come out soon. Stay Tune!

### iOS / macOS
* Fix an assert error of encrypted MMKV when encoding some `<NSCoding>` objects.
* Fix a potential leak when decoding duplicated keys from the file.
* Add `+[MMKV pageSize]`, `+[MMKV version]` methods.
* Add `+[MMKV defaultMMKVWithCryptKey:]`, you can encrypt the default MMKV instance now, just like the Android users who already enjoy this for a long time.
* Rename `-[MMKV getValueSizeForKey:]` to `-[MMKV getValueSizeForKey: actualSize:]` to align with Android interface.

### Android
* Fix a potential crash when getting MMKV instances in multi-thread at the same time.
* Add `MMKV.version()` method.

## v1.2.4 / 2020-10-21
This is a hotfix mainly for iOS.

### iOS / macOS
* Fix a decode error of encrypted MMKV on some devices.

### Android
* Fix a potential issue on checking `rootDir` in multi-thread while MMKV initialization is not finished.

## v1.2.3 / 2020-10-16

* Fix a potential crash on 32-bit devices due to pointer alignment issue.
* Fix a decode error of encrypted MMKV on some 32-bit devices.

### iOS / macOS
* Fix a potential `crc32()` crash on some kind of arm64 devices.
* Fix a potential crash after calling `+[MMKV onAppTerminate]`.

### Android
* Fix a rare lock conflict on `checkProcessMode()`.

### POSIX
Add MMKV support for **Python** on POSIX platforms.  Most things actually work!  
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Tencent/MMKV/wiki/python_setup) for more info.

## v1.2.2 / 2020-07-30

### iOS / macOS
* Add auto clean up feature. Call `+[MMKV enableAutoCleanUp:]` to enable auto cleanup MMKV instances that not been accessed recently.
* Fix a potential crash on devices under iPhone X.

### Android
* Add multi-process mode check. After so many issues had been created due to mistakenly using MMKV in multi-process mode in Android, this check is added. If an MMKV instance is accessed with `SINGLE_PROCESS_MODE` in multi-process, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

### POSIX
* Add support for armv7 & arm64 arch on Linux.

## v1.2.1 / 2020-07-03
This is a hotfix release. Anyone who has upgraded to v1.2.0 should upgrade to this version **immediately**.

* Fix a potential file corruption bug when writing a file that was created in versions older than v1.2.0. This bug was introduced in v1.2.0.
* Add a preprocess directive `MMKV_DISABLE_CRYPT` to turn off MMKV encryption ability once and for all. If you integrate MMKV by source code, and if you are pretty sure encryption is not needed, you can turn that off to save some binary size.
* The parameter `relativePath` (customizing a separate folder for an MMKV instance), has been renamed to `rootPath`. Making it clear that an absolute path is expected for that parameter.

### iOS / macOS
* `-[MMKV mmkvWithID: relativePath:]` is deprecated. Use `-[MMKV mmkvWithID: rootPath:]` instead. 
* Likewise, `-[MMKV mmkvWithID: cryptKey: relativePath:]` is deprecated. Use `-[MMKV mmkvWithID: cryptKey: rootPath:]` instead. 

## v1.2.0 / 2020-06-30
This is the second **major version** of MMKV. Everything you call is the same as the last version, while almost everything underneath has been improved. 

* **Reduce Memory Footprint**. We used to cache all key-values in a dictionary for efficiency. From now on we store the offset of each key-value inside the mmap-memory instead, **reducing memory footprint by almost half** for (non-encrypt) MMKV. And the accessing efficiency is almost the same as before. As for encrypted MMKV, we can't simply store the offset of each key-value, the relative encrypt info needs to be stored as well. That will be too much for small key-values. We only store such info for large key-values (larger than 256B).
* **Improve Writeback Efficiency**. Thanks to the optimization above, we now can implement writeback by simply calling **memmove()** multiple times. Efficiency is increased and memory consumption is down.
* **Optimize Small Key-Values**. Small key-values of encrypted MMKV are still cached in memory, as all the old versions did. From now on, the struct `MMBuffer` will try to **store small values in the stack** instead of in the heap, saving a lot of time from `malloc()` & `free()`. In fact, all primitive types will be store in the stack memory.

All of the improvements above are available to all supported platforms. Here are the additional changes for each platform.

### iOS / macOS
* **Optimize insert & delete**. Especially for inserting new values to **existing keys**, or deleting keys. We now use the UTF-8 encoded keys in the mmap-memory instead of live encoding from keys, cutting the cost of string encoding conversion.
* Fix Xcode compile error on some projects.
* Drop the support of iOS 8. `thread_local` is not available on iOS 8. We choose to drop support instead of working around because iOS 8's market share is considerably small.

### POSIX
* It's known that GCC before 5.0 doesn't support C++17 standard very well. You should upgrade to the latest version of GCC to compile MMKV.

## v1.1.2 / 2020-05-29

### Android / iOS & macOS / Win32 / POSIX

* Fix a potential crash after `trim()` a multi-process MMKV instance.
* Improve `clearAll()` a bit.

## v1.1.1 / 2020-04-13

### iOS / macOS

* Support WatchOS.
* Rename `+[MMKV onExit]` to `+[MMKV onAppTerminate]`, to avoid naming conflict with some other OpenSource projects.
* Make background write protection much more robust, fix a potential crash when writing meta info in background.
* Fix a potential data corruption bug when writing a UTF-8 (non-ASCII) key.

### Android

* Fix a crash in the demo project when the App is hot reloaded.
* Improve wiki & readme to recommend users to init & destruct MMKV in the `Application` class instead of the `MainActivity` class.

### POSIX
* Fix two compile errors with some compilers.

## v1.1.0 / 2020-03-24
This is the first **major breaking version** ever since MMKV was made public in September 2018, introducing bunches of improvement. Due to the Covid-19, it has been delayed for about a month. Now it's finally here! 

* **Improved File Recovery Strategic**. We store the CRC checksum & actual file size on each sync operation & full write back, plus storing the actual file size in the same file(aka the .crc meta file) as the CRC checksum. Base on our usage inside WeChat on the iOS platform, it cuts the file **corruption rate down by almost half**.
* **Unified Core Library**. We refactor the whole MMKV project and unify the cross-platform Core library. From now on, MMKV on iOS/macOS, Android, Win32 all **share the same core logic code**. It brings many benefits such as reducing the work to fix common bugs, improvements on one platform are available to other platforms immediately, and much more.
* **Supports POSIX Platforms**. Thanks to the unified Core library, we port MMKV to POSIX platforms easily.
* **Multi-Process Access on iOS/macOS**. Thanks to the unified Core library, we add multi-process access to iOS/macOS platforms easily.
* **Efficiency Improvement**. We make the most of armv8 ability including the AES & CRC32 instructions to tune **encryption & error checking speed up by one order higher** than before on armv8 devices. There are bunches of other speed tuning all around the whole project.

Here are the old-style change logs of each platform.

### iOS / macOS
* Adds **multi-process access** support. You should initialize MMKV by calling `+[MMKV initializeMMKV: groupDir: logLevel:]`, passing your **app group id**. Then you can get a multi-process instance by calling `+[MMKV mmkvWithID: mode:]` or `+[MMKV mmkvWithID: cryptKey: mode:]`, accessing it cross your app & your app extensions.
* Add **inter-process content change notification**. You can get MMKV changes notification of other processes by implementing `- onMMKVContentChange:` of `<MMKVHandler>` protocol.
* **Improved File Recovery Strategic**. Cuts the file corruption rate down by almost half. Details are above.
* **Efficiency Improvement**. Encryption & error checking speed are up by one order higher on armv8 devices(aka iDevice including iPhone 5S and above). Encryption on armv7 devices is improved as well. Details are ahead.
* Other speed improvements. Refactor core logic using **MRC**, improve std::vector `push_back()` speed by using **move constructors** & move assignments.
* `+[MMKV setMMKVBasePath:]` & `+[MMKV setLogLevel:]` are marked **deprecated**. You should use `+[MMKV initializeMMKV:]` or `+[MMKV initializeMMKV: logLevel:]` instead.
* The `MMKVLogLevel` enum has been improved in Swift. It can be used like `MMKVLogLevel.info` and so on.

### Android
* **Improved File Recovery Strategic**. Cuts the file corruption rate down by almost half. Details are above.
* **Efficiency Improvement**. Encryption & error checking speed are up by one order higher on armv8 devices with the `arm64-v8a` abi. Encryption on `armeabi` & `armeabi-v7a` is improved as well. Details are ahead.
* Add exception inside core encode & decode logic, making MMKV much more robust.
* Other speed improvements. Improve std::vector `push_back()` speed by using **move constructors** & move assignments.

### Win32
* **Improved File Recovery Strategic**. Cuts the file corruption rate down by almost half. Details are above.
* Add exception inside core encode & decode logic, making MMKV much more robust.
* Other speed improvements. Improve std::vector `push_back()` speed by using **move constructors** & move assignments.

### POSIX
* Most things actually work! We have tested MMKV on the latest version of Linux(Ubuntu, Arch Linux, CentOS, Gentoo), and Unix(macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD) on the time v1.1.0 is released.

## v1.0.11 / 2018-10-12
### iOS / macOS
What's new  

* Port to **macOS**
* Support **NSCoding**  
You can  store NSArray/NSDictionary or any object what implements `<NSCoding>` protocol.
* Redesign Swift interface
* Some performance improvement

Known Issues

* MMKV use mmapID as its filename, so don't contain any `/` inside mmapID.
* Storing a value of `type A` and getting by `type B` may not work. MMKV does type erasure while storing values. That means it's hard for MMKV to do value-type-checking, if not impossible.

### Android 
What's new  

* Some performance improvement

Known Issues

* Getting an MMKV instance with mmapID that contains `/` may fail.  
MMKV uses mmapID as its filename, so don't contain any `/` inside mmapID.
* Storing a value of `type A` and getting by `type B` may not work.  
MMKV does type erasure while storing values. That means it's hard for MMKV to do value-type-checking, if not impossible.
* `registerOnSharedPreferenceChangeListener` not supported.  
This is intended. We believe doing data-change-listener inside a storage framework smells really bad to us. We suggest using something like event-bus to notify any interesting clients.

## v1.0.10 / 2018-09-21  

 * Initial Release
