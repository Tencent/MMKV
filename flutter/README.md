MMKV is an **efficient**, **small**, **easy-to-use** mobile key-value storage framework used in the WeChat application. It's currently available on **Android** and **iOS**.

# MMKV for Flutter

## Features

* **Efficient**. MMKV uses mmap to keep memory synced with file, and protobuf to encode/decode values, making the most of native platform to achieve best performance.
  * **Multi-Process concurrency**: MMKV supports concurrent read-read and read-write access between processes.

* **Easy-to-use**. You can use MMKV as you go. All changes are saved immediately, no `sync`, no `apply` calls needed.

* **Small**.
  * **A handful of files**: MMKV contains process locks, encode/decode helpers and mmap logics and nothing more. It's really tidy.
  * **About 100K in binary size**: MMKV adds about 100K per architecture on App size, and much less when zipped (apk/ipa).


## Getting Started

### Installation
Add the following lines to `pubspec.yaml` on your app module. Then run `flutter pub get`.

```yaml
dependencies:
  mmkv: ">=1.3.0"
  ...
```

If you already include MMKV native lib in your App, you need to upgrade to version newer than v1.3.0.  

#### iOS  
To avoid conflict of the native lib name 'libMMKV.so' on iOS, we need to **change the plugin name 'mmkv' to 'mmkvflutter'**.  

##### For a purely flutter App:  
* Add this function `fix_mmkv_plugin_name()` to `ios/Podfile`, invoke it **before** calling any `flutter_xxx()` functions. Run `pod install` and we are all set.  
* **Note**: you need to run `pod install` each time you have called `flutter pub get`, or has just returned to Xcode from Android Studio. 
* We recommend **using Xcode** to debug iOS App.

```ruby
def fix_mmkv_plugin_name(flutter_application_path)
  is_module = false
  plugin_deps_file = File.expand_path(File.join(flutter_application_path, '..', '.flutter-plugins-dependencies'))
  if not File.exists?(plugin_deps_file)
    is_module = true;
    plugin_deps_file = File.expand_path(File.join(flutter_application_path, '.flutter-plugins-dependencies'))
  end

  plugin_deps = JSON.parse(File.read(plugin_deps_file)).dig('plugins', 'ios') || []
  plugin_deps.each do |plugin|
    if plugin['name'] == 'mmkv' || plugin['name'] == 'mmkvflutter'
      require File.expand_path(File.join(plugin['path'], 'tool', 'mmkvpodhelper.rb'))
      mmkv_fix_plugin_name(flutter_application_path, is_module)
      return
    end
  end
  raise "Fail to find any mmkv plugin dependencies. If you're running pod install manually, make sure flutter pub get is executed first"
end

fix_mmkv_plugin_name(File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__)))
```

##### For using flutter as a module:  
* For **[embding flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/project-setup#embed-the-flutter-module-in-your-existing-application)** to your existing iOS App, add the function `fix_mmkv_plugin_name()` above to your iOS App's `Podfile`, invoke it **before** calling any `flutter_xxx()` functions. Run `pod install` and we are all set.
* **Note**: you need to run `pod install` each time you have called `flutter pub get`, or has just returned to Xcode from Android Studio. 
* We recommend **using Xcode** to debug iOS App.

```ruby
def fix_mmkv_plugin_name(flutter_application_path)
  .....
end

flutter_application_path = 'path/to/your/flutter_module'

fix_mmkv_plugin_name(flutter_application_path)

```

**Note**: You can find the [script](https://github.com/Tencent/MMKV/blob/master/flutter/tool/fix_mmkv_plugin_name.rb) inside mmkv plugin under path `tool/fix_mmkv_plugin_name.rb`.

#### Android  
If you previously use `com.tencent.mmkv-static` or `com.tencent.mmkv-shared` in your Android App, you should move to `com.tencent.mmkv`.
And if your App depends on any 3rd SDK that embeds `com.tencent.mmkv-static` or `com.tencent.mmkv-shared`, you can add this lines to your `build.gradle` to avoid conflict:

```gradle
    dependencies {
        ...

        modules {
            module("com.tencent:mmkv-static") {
                replacedBy("com.tencent:mmkv", "Using mmkv for flutter")
            }
            module("com.tencent:mmkv-shared") {
                replacedBy("com.tencent:mmkv", "Using mmkv for flutter")
            }
        }
    }
```

### Setup
You can use MMKV as you go. All changes are saved immediately, no `sync`, no `apply` calls needed.  
Setup MMKV on App startup, say your `main()` function, add these lines:

```dart
import 'package:mmkv/mmkv.dart';

void main() async {

  // must wait for MMKV to finish initialization
  final rootDir = await MMKV.initialize();
  print('MMKV for flutter with rootDir = $rootDir');

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
Note that you have to **wait for MMKV to finish initialization** before accessing any MMKV instance.

### CRUD Operations

* MMKV has a global instance, that can be used directly:

    ```dart
    import 'package:mmkv/mmkv.dart';
        
    var mmkv = MMKV.defaultMMKV();
    mmkv.encodeBool('bool', true);
    print('bool = ${mmkv.decodeBool('bool')}');
    
    mmkv.encodeInt32('int32', (1<<31) - 1);
    print('max int32 = ${mmkv.decodeInt32('int32')}');
    
    mmkv.encodeInt('int', (1<<63) - 1);
    print('max int = ${mmkv.decodeInt('int')}');
    
    String str = 'Hello Flutter from MMKV';
    mmkv.encodeString('string', str);
    print('string = ${mmkv.decodeString('string')}');

    str = 'Hello Flutter from MMKV with bytes';
    var bytes = MMBuffer.fromList(Utf8Encoder().convert(str))!;
    mmkv.encodeBytes('bytes', bytes);
    bytes.destroy();

    bytes = mmkv.decodeBytes('bytes')!;
    print('bytes = ${Utf8Decoder().convert(bytes.asList()!)}');
    bytes.destroy();
    ```

    As you can see, MMKV is quite easy to use.
    
    **Note**: If you come across to failing to load `defaultMMKV()` **on Android** after **upgrading** Flutter from 1.20+ to 2.0+, you can try passing this encryption key `'\u{2}U'` instead.  

   ```dart
   var mmkv = MMKV.defaultMMKV(cryptKey: '\u{2}U');
   ```
    
* **Deleting & Querying**:

    ```dart
    var mmkv = MMKV.defaultMMKV();

    mmkv.removeValue('bool');
    print('contains "bool": ${mmkv.containsKey('bool')}');

    mmkv.removeValues(['int32', 'int']);
    print('all keys: ${mmkv.allKeys}');
    ```

* If different modules/logic need **isolated storage**, you can also create your own MMKV instance separately:

    ```dart
    var mmkv = MMKV("test");
    mmkv.encodeBool('bool', true);
    print('bool = ${mmkv.decodeBool('bool')}');
    ```

* If **multi-process accessing** is neededï¼Œyou can set `MMKV.MULTI_PROCESS_MODE` on MMKV initialization:

    ```dart
    var mmkv = MMKV("test-multi-process", mode: MMKVMode.MULTI_PROCESS_MODE);
    mmkv.encodeBool('bool', true);
    print('bool = ${mmkv.decodeBool('bool')}');
    ```

### Supported Types
* Primitive Types:
  - `bool, int, double`

* Classes & Collections:
  - `String, List<int>, MMBuffer`

### Log

* By default, MMKV prints log to logcat/console, which is not convenient for diagnosing online issues. 
You can setup MMKV **log redirecting** on App startup on the **native** interface of MMKV. 
Checkout how to do it on [Android](https://github.com/Tencent/MMKV/wiki/android_advance#log) / [iOS](https://github.com/Tencent/MMKV/wiki/ios_advance#log).
Due to the current limitation of Flutter runtime, we can't redirect log on the Flutter side.

* You can turn off MMKV's logging once and for all on initialization (which we strongly disrecommend).  

    ```dart
    final rootDir = await MMKV.initialize(logLevel: MMKVLogLevel.None);
    ```
### Encryption
* By default MMKV stores all key-values in plain text on file, relying on Android's/iOS's sandbox to make sure the file is encrypted. Should you worry about information leaking, you can choose to encrypt MMKV.

    ```dart
    final encryptKey = 'MyEncryptKey';
    var mmkv = MMKV("test-encryption", cryptKey: encryptKey);
    ```

* You can change the encryption key later as you like. You can also change an existing MMKV instance from encrypted to unencrypted, or vice versa.

    ```dart
    // an unencrypted MMKV instance
    var mmkv = MMKV("test-encryption");

    // change from unencrypted to encrypted
    mmkv.reKey("Key_seq_1");

    // change encryption key
    mmkv.reKey("Key_seq_2");

    // change from encrypted to unencrypted
    kmmkv.reKey(null);
    ```
 
### Customize location
* By default, MMKV stores file inside `$(FilesDir)/mmkv/`. You can customize MMKV's **root directory** on App startup:

    ```dart
    final dir = await getApplicationSupportDirectory();
    final rootDir = await MMKV.initialize(dir, rootDir: dir.path + '/mmkv_2');
    print('MMKV for flutter with rootDir = $rootDir');
    ```

* You can even customize any MMKV instance's location:

    ```dart
    final dir = await getApplicationSupportDirectory();
    var mmkv = MMKV('testCustomDir', rootDir: dir.path + '/mmkv_3');
    ```
  **Note:** It's recommended to store MMKV files **inside** your App's sandbox path. **DO NOT** store them on external storage(aka SD card). If you have to do it, you should  follow Android's [scoped storage](https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/storage) enforcement.
