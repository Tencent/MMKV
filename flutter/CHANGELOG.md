* Hide some OpenSSL symbols to prevent link-time symbol conflict, when an App somehow also static linking OpenSSL.

* Keep up with MMKV native lib v1.2.10.

## v1.2.10 / 2021-05-26
* Bug Fixed: When calling `MMKV.encodeString()` with an empty string value on Android, `MMKV.decodeString()` will return `null`.
* Bug Fixed: After upgrading from Flutter 1.20+ to 2.0+, calling `MMKV.defaultMMKV()` on Android might fail to load, you can try calling `MMKV.defaultMMKV(cryptKey: '\u{2}U')` instead.
* Keep up with MMKV native lib v1.2.9, which drops the **armeabi** arch on Android.

## v1.2.9 / 2021-05-06
* Support null-safety.
* Upgrade to Flutter 2.0.
* Keep up with MMKV native lib v1.2.8, which migrates the Android Native Lib to Maven Central Repository.
* Fix `MMKV.encodeString()` crash on iOS with an empty string value.

### Known Issue
* When calling `MMKV.encodeString()` with an empty string value on Android, `MMKV.decodeString()` will return `null`. This bug will be fixed in the next version of Android Native Lib. iOS does not have such a bug.
